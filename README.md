# ProofAI

ðŸš€ **Introducing ProofAI â€“ A Decentralized AI Training & Validation Platform** ðŸ”¥

Iâ€™m excited to share ProofAI, a blockchain-powered platform that brings secure, decentralized machine learning to the next level! With IPFS integration, users can:

âœ… Train AI models on decentralized nodes  
âœ… Validate results using Proof-of-Work  
âœ… Store and fetch datasets securely via CID  
âœ… Seamlessly switch roles between Miner & Validator  

ðŸ’¡ Whether you're a researcher, developer, or blockchain enthusiast, ProofAI is redefining AI collaboration in a trustless environment.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can download ProofAI executables from the tags section of the repository:

- **[proofai.exe](https://github.com/MuhammadAbdullah950/ProofAI/tags)**  
- **[Proofi_networkManager.exe](https://github.com/MuhammadAbdullah950/ProofAI/tags)**  

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAbdullah950/ProofAI.git
cd ProofAI
```

### Usage

To run ProofAI, simply execute the downloaded binaries:

```sh
./proofai.exe
./Proofi_networkManager.exe
```

If you cloned the repository, follow the instructions in the relevant directories to build and run the code.

### IPFS Node

To use ProofAI, one person in the cluster or chain needs to run an IPFS node. You can find more information on setting up and running an IPFS node [here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/).

### Model Training

You can use the model training sample from the following repository:

- **[Model Training Code Example on ProofAI](https://github.com/MuhammadAbdullah950/ProofAI-Training)**
